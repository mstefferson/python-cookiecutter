## Installation

1. Make sure you have Poetry installed. If not, you can install it by following the instructions in the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/{{cookiecutter.package_name}}.git
cd {{cookiecutter.package_name}}
```

3. Initialize the Poetry environment and install the project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

This command will create a virtual environment for the project and install all the required dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

## Installing Additional Packages

To install additional packages in your project, you can use the following Poetry commands:

- To install a package as a main dependency:

```bash
poetry add <package-name>
```

- To install a package as a development dependency:

```bash
poetry add --dev <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to install.

Poetry will automatically update the `pyproject.toml` file and the `poetry.lock` file to include the newly installed packages.
